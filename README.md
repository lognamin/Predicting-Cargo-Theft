# Predicting-Cargo-Theft
Machine Learning Project to classify items that is targeted by cargo theft, and predicting the recovered amount.

Methods used in predicting the type of items stolen through classification:
1) Stratified Sampling
2) Random Forest
3) SGD
4) Adaboost
5) Gridsearch used for hypertuning


Methods used in predicting the value of recovered items through classification:
1) SVM
2) Random Forest
3) Extreme Gradient Boosting
4) Regularization : Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net
